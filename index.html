	<h1>Quick Information about my program</h1>
<p><b>What is this program about?</b></p>
	<p>This computer program that I have programmed is a Website Canvas, which uses Javascript and html code to create a working and interactive canvas. 
	<br>
	<br>
	This canvas allows the user to choose different shapes such as a line, rectangle, ellipse, different numbered of pentagon sides (meaning the user 
	could have a 5 sided pentagon) and different numbered of star points (this means, a user can click a star with 7 points or 5 points). 
	There are 3 types of brush sizes that a user can choose from. For the finishing touches, I have created a fun animated ellipse which
	stretches horizontally and vertically. 
	<br>
	<br>
	I have also allowed the user to change colours of their shapes as they create more shapes on the canvas. The colours are picked from the 
	colour palette. I have also selected a default colour when the user first uses the canvas. 
	<br>
	There is also an undo and clear button for the user incase anything goes wrong.

	<p><b>Creating and Testing Program</b></p>
	<p>In Sprint One, I have decided to create a simple sprint by allowing the mouse to click and drag to create a basic rectangle. At the moment, it works anywhere on the canvas. 
		I first started with a basic rectangle which only prints on the screen. The second step was to get the mouse down, move and up to be working. I got this to work by using "console.log".
		The third step was to use the console.log to check whether the click and drag were recorded each time. This meant I had to check if each rectangle being printed on the canvas was being 
		entered into the list. The last step was the get the rectangle
		to appear when the drag and drop happens.  
	</p>
	<br>
	<p><b><u>Reflection</u></b></p>
	<p><b>Errors and Reflection:</b></p>
	<p>When I was creating Sprint One, there were not many major or minor errors. The process was created from what I had learnt in the educational videos 
		I watched in class. I thought about what is the most basic thing I can do for the first sprint? (The Simplicity). What is the minimum product I can show?<br>
		I was able to work the click and drag mouse, after a series of help from the teacher. I have attached a video of what this sprint can do.<br>
		A problem that occurs in this sprint was when the mouse goes out of the canvas, the rectangle does not get created.</p>
	<p><b>Future Steps:</b></p>
	<p>I’m just taking little steps at a time. Since javascript is still a new language. My next steps are to be able to draw shapes within a boundary - maybe creating a canvas within a canvas.</p>

	<h1>Sprint Two</h1>
	<p><b>Aim:</b><br>The aim of Sprint Two is to create a certain
		 spot on the canvas, which allows the user to drag down in
		  the drawing area. The red drag box is defined by the 
		  Mouse Start and where the mouse ends up going. The program 
		  allows the user to create rectangles on the defined drawing area. </p>
	<br>
	<p><u><b>Plan</b></u></p>
	<p><b>Sprint (Kanban) Board:</b></p>
	<p>Screenshot shown on the far right</p>
	<p><b>Sprint Planning:</b></p>
	<p>Screenshot shown on the far right</p>
	<br>
	<p><b><u>Build</u></b></p>

	<p><b>Creating and Testing Program</b></p>
	<p>In Sprint Two, I have created a drawing rectangle canvas with a boundary around it, 
		so the user can only draw shapes within the boundary. 
		<br>
		<br>
		The drawing rectangle canvas is an already printed rectangle which acts as a canvas 
		board for the user to draw on. I did not blend the drawing rectangle canvas with the 
		outer canvas, so the user would know where to draw.
		<br>
		<br>
		This is shown in my testing video (attached at the bottom of sprint two). In the 
		first fifteen seconds (0:00 seconds to 0:15 seconds), I checked if the boundary 
		is happening in the green rectangle. To check this: I had used console log. You 
		can see, that I click on the canvas and the drawing rectangle canvas corners. 
		When I click on the canvas corner - it shows it was false, while when I clicked 
		in the drawing rectangle canvas corners - it shows it was true. Again, this shows 
		the boundary is working. If the user clicks and drags within the ‘true’ boundary, 
		the rectangle would appear. This would not work if the user clicks and drags 
		within the ‘false’ (outside of the drawing rectangle canvas) boundary, so 
		therefore the rectangle would not appear. 
		<br>
		In the testing video, I’ve shown the boundary works by clicking and dragging 
		at 0:19 seconds to 0:30 seconds.</p>
	<br>
	<p><b><u>Reflection</u></b></p>
	<p><b>Errors:</b></p>
	<p>There’s one main error in this sprint, the user can draw a rectangle by click 
		and dragging the mouse from the ‘true’ boundary (in the boundary) to the 
		‘false’ boundary (outside of the boundary). In the testing video, I have 
		shown where this error occurs at about 0:21 seconds to 0:22 seconds.
		<br>
		<br>
		This error occurs because when the mouse is being pressed down within the 
		'true' boundary, the program notes down that it can draw a rectangle 
		here. As the mouse is still pressing (clicks down on the mouse pad) and 
		drags to when the boundary is 'false' and then releases (when the 
		user's finger is no longer clicking down on the mouse pad) the mouse, 
		it would create a rectangle because the program thinks that it is still 
		within the true boundary even though it's false. The program doesn't 
		known it's in the false boundary until the mouse is unclicked.
</p>
	<p><b>Reflection:</b></p>
	<p>I think sprint two went successfully well. I’m still getting the hang of 
		javascript, it is an adjustment from python to javascript as I assumed 
		it would be the same or at least closely the same. The error I have 
		mentioned above may or might not be solved until I have reached sprint 
		6 or 7. This is because it’s not the most important thing on my list. I 
		just needed the basics to be working before I move on to minor details.</p>
	<p><b>Future Steps:</b></p>
	<p>In the next sprint, I am thinking of allowing the user to have another 
		shape choices other than a rectangle for the user to draw on the 
		rectangle drawing canvas. For this to be able to work, a button would 
		need to be involved.

	<h1>Sprint Three</h1>
	<p><b>Aim:</b><br>The aim for Sprint Three is to allow the user to click from the 
		choices of two buttons, which allows them to select a particular shape and 
		also being able to draw them on the drawing rectangle.</p>

	<p><b>Creating and Testing Program</b></p>
	<p>What’s special about this sprint are the buttons on the canvas. 
		This allows the user to have different shape choices. 
		<br>
		<br>
		Before the class was given the internal, we were taught the basics. 
		This includes coding a button. Since I had done the buttons task, I was 
		able to use it in this internal and adapt it to the internal we are given. 
		In this case it was naming the buttons to the shape name and giving them 
		a purpose. The purpose for the buttons is to allow the user to draw the 
		shape of the button’s name. For example: if the button’s name is called ‘ellipse’ 
		and the user clicks on it. The user should be able to draw an ellipse on the drawing
		 rectangle canvas. <br>
		Once the button is created, the next step is to give the button the purpose (as I 
		have mentioned above). To be able to give the user choices of different shapes, I 
		had to research how I could create an ellipse. I decided to choose an ellipse because 
		it gives the user more choices with their drawing as it allows the user to draw an oval
		 and a circle. </p>
	<br>
	<p><b><u>Reflection</u></b></p>
	<p><b>Errors</b></p>
	<p>There are no new errors in this sprint as shown on my testing video. 
		The same error which I had on sprint two still occurs, as I haven’t resolved it yet. 
	</p>
	<p><b>Reflection:</b></p>
	<p>I personally think sprint three went well. It was rather confusing but it was 
		manageable. There were a lot of thinking involved for the drawing ellipse 
		shape as we weren’t given the formula of how to create one. My friends and I 
		had to research how an ellipse could be created using javascript. This was 
		one of the many difficult tasks as a lot of coders from the internet said 
		different things. I have also placed all my code through the javascript code 
		checker - incase if i had missed a semi-colon.</p>
	<p><b>Future Steps:</b></p>
	<p>In sprint four, I am possibly thinking of adding a colour palette to add 
		some colour variety for the user to use. I am also thinking of changing 
		the colour of the canvas, drawing rectangle canvas and buttons to look 
		more aesthetically pleasing.</p>

	<h1>Sprint Four</h1>
	<p><b>Aim:</b><br>The aim for sprint four is to create a colour grid (colour palette), which allows

	<p><b>Creating and Testing Program</b></p>
	<p>Colour Palette:<br>
		For sprint four, I have created a colour palette before the actual internal started. I made a colour 
		palette which wasn’t interactive but it was pasted on the side of the canvas. There were a lot of similarities 
		between the colour palette and a button so I have decided to draw a Venn diagram which shows the differences 
		and similarities between the two. To be able to make an interactive colour palette, I had used the boundaries 
		and the background colour from the buttons. Since the palette didn’t need any texts, I decided not to put any. 
		The most important difference between a button and the colour palette were the looping that was needed. A 
		loop was essential for this sprint because it would be easier than coding for one colour block than multiple.<br><br>
		Sprint Design Decisions:<br>
		On the far right of the screen, there is a picture written as ‘Screenshot of Sprint Four’s Planning Board 
		(Part 2)’. There were two options which I could do with sprint three and four. The first option was to put 
		the colour palette with the buttons in sprint three as they were very similar to each other. Or the second 
		option was to have the buttons and colour palette in their own sprints. I decided to follow through with the 
		second option because it would be easier for me to understand what is going on and also it won’t be a huge git 
		push at the end of sprint three.</p>
	<br>
	<p><b><u>Reflection</u></b></p>
	<p><b>Errors</b></p>
	<p>While making this sprint, there were a lot of trail and errors involved. I didn't manage to screen record or capture 
		any of the errors I made. I knew I should have done this but I thought it wasn't important as it was part of the 
		process of creating a colour palette. most of my errors occured in my classmates as well, so I thought it wasn't 
		important to document it.</p>
	<p><b>Reflection:</b></p>
	<p>I think this sprint is slightly more advanced than the last sprint, as there were some concepts from buttons that were used 
		for the colour palette. The advanced concepts that I struggled with the most were the loop function which produced more 
		than one colour square.</p>
	<p><b>Future Steps:</b></p>
	<p>For my next sprint (sprint 5), I am considering improving on my canvas by creating more shape buttons for the user to choose 
		from and possibly maybe add a undo and clear button.</p>

	<p>In sprint five, I have researched how a star, hexagon and a line was drawn. Once I knew how to draw them, it is important to
		 test if they work. The next step is to put the shapes and buttons together. This allows the user to draw the shapes by 
		 clicking and dragging on the canvas. There were a couple of errors which popped up during this. I will attach the videos 
		 and explain later on about those errors.<br>
		I have also decided in this sprint to create an undo & clear button. This is important because all basic programs will an 
		undo and clear button for it to be called a decent program. I have also decided to improve on the boundary in the drawing 
		rectangle canvas, so I coded a small code which would cut the shape off, if the user drags their mouse from within the 
		canvas and off it.
		<br>
		<br>
		5.5 on the planning board is a small idea that would be useful for me to improve on. I decided to choose colours for
		 the colour palette that weren’t the basic rainbow colours. I was trying to keep it original by creating pastel/
		 soft colours. </p>

	<p><b>Future Steps:</b></p>

		to use the already made ellipse class with the button.<br>
		<br>
		A free drawing brush is created when the mouse is clicked down and moving. The circle is then being 
		pasted as the mouse is moving. I have decided to put a free drawing brush for the user to choose 
		because it gives them freedom to do what they want to draw.</p>
	<p><b>Limitations</b></p>
	<p>As the brush is being created, I found a limitation. When the user uses the brush function to draw,
		 it works perfectly while, if the brush is being moved too quickly. Spots of circles would appear, 
		 this is because the frame rate for the page is at its max. The frame rate of my drawing page is at 
		 40 frames per a second.</p>
	<br>
	<p><b><u>Reflection</u></b></p>
	<p><b>Errors</b></p>
	<p>In sprint six, there is one main error that is shown in the testing video. From 0:04 seconds to 0:07 seconds, 
		when the user had drawn a line, the default colour did not show up on the line but it did for the brush function. 
		<br>
		I am planning to use this error and improve on this for the next sprint.</p>
	<p><b>Reflection:</b></p>
	<p>I personally think sprint six went well. Creating the free drawing brush surprised me, I thought it would be difficult
		to create but instead I had used the ellipse class to create a brush.</p>
	<p><b>Future Steps:</b></p>
	<p>In Sprint seven, the aim is to improve on the free drawing brush, hexagon and star shape. I am thinking of improving
		 the sprint by adding more buttons with the different sized brushes and possibility adding different types 
		 of pentagon & stars.</p>

	<p><b>Reflection:</b></p>
	<p>The circle button in this sprint was one of the hardest classes I've made. This was because I couldn't use the premade ellipse class to make 
		an interactive circle button. I had to make a whole new circle button class for the button to work.</p>
	<p><b>Future Steps:</b></p>
	<p>Since I am near finishing, I have decided to create an interactive shape that the user can use on the 
		canvas. I haven’t decided what I wanted to do but my friends made a spinning star or an ellipse, I am 
		thinking of doing something different or similar.</p>

	<h1>Sprint Eight</h1>
	<p><b>Aim:</b><br>To create an animated shape, which an user can use but it can not be the same or similar to any of my 
		friends animated shapes.</p>
	<br>
	<p><u><b>Plan</b></u></p>
	<p><b>Sprint (Kanban) Board:</b></p>

	<br>
	<p><b><u>Build</u></b></p>
	<p><b>Creating and Testing Program</b></p>
	<p>In Sprint Eight, I have created a funky and interesting animated shape design. This is to just 
		improve on my shape choices for the user to choose from.<br>
		<br>
		The funky animated shape design is an ellipse shape which moves in wave motions horizontally and vertically. 
		I have used the basic ellipse shape which moves horizontally using the cosine unit circle, while ellipse moving vertically 
		is using the sine unit circle. If I sketched out a sine and cosine graph, the sin graph is just shifted to the left. This is 
		why the animated shape ellipse is slightly off timed horizontally and vertically.<br>
		If I had put the horizontal and vertical movement of the ellipse with sine, it would move the ellipse as if it was pulsing. In 
		the testing video, the user had use the animated ellipse shape which shows the horizontally and vertically motion is slightly 
		off time. This was the animated ellipse shape I wanted to make.<br>
		The magic erase was invented by an error. I decided to put it on my canvas because I thought it would give the user some fun 
		choices to remove shapes. It only works if the user creates more than one shape on the canvas. The magic erase works 
		better in the free drawing brush tool rather than the normal shape.</p>
	<br>
	<p><b><u>Reflection</u></b></p>
	<p><b>Errors</b></p>
	<p>According to my testing video, there weren't any major errors. Although there is one minor error which I found in (0:10 seconds to 0:15 seconds), when the user clicks 
		and drags from the drawing rectangle to a button. It selects the button where the user's mouse unpresses or unclicks from. This is 
		a minor error which could be fixed easily. <br>
		I would just like to note, there are no programs that are perfect. There is always something to improve on whether it's something major or minor.</p>
	<p><b>Reflection:</b></p>
	<p>Sprint eight is actually one of my smallest sprints I've done compared to the other sprints. I could have mashed sprint seven 
		and eight together, but I decided not to because there were a lot of errors which occurred so I decided to split them to sprints seven and eight.
		Overall I think sprint eight was the most relaxed sprint I've done.</p>
	<p><b>Future Steps:</b></p>
	<p>Since I'm handing in my assignment but, if I continued improving my program on my own time. My next sprint improvement
		would be able to change the colour of the drawn rectangle canvas and also improve on the minor errors I have found in this sprint.</p>
